Joy to the World
================

Spread the joy by giving gifts.  But we can't just buy gifts for everybody, so it's good to have an exchange!  Use this program to determine who should give to whom completely pseudo-randomly, with nobody stuck with their own name.

    $ python christmas.py Santa Hermey Rudolf Clarice Bumble YukonCornelius
    Santa gives to Clarice
    Hermey gives to Rudolf
    Rudolf gives to Santa
    Clarice gives to YukonCornelius
    Bumble gives to Hermey
    YukonCornelius gives to Bumble

Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night!
